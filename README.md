# Scalable Django REST Backend Architecture

This repository demonstrates how I design and structure scalable,
secure backend systems using Django and Django REST Framework.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview
- Modular Django app structure
- RESTful API design using DRF
- Secure authentication & RBAC
- Asynchronous task processing
- Production-ready deployment setup

## 🏗️ Key Components
- Django + Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis + Celery for async jobs
- JWT-based authentication
- Dockerized services
- CI/CD-ready structure

## 🔐 Security
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Permission-driven APIs
- Secure authentication flows
- Input validation & rate limiting

## ⚡ Performance & Scalability
- Optimized ORM queries
- Caching strategies
- Background task processing
- Stateless API design

## ☁️ Deployment
- Docker-based local & production setup
- Environment-based configuration
- Cloud-ready (AWS compatible)

## 🎯 Purpose
This project reflects real-world backend patterns I’ve used in
enterprise systems such as healthcare platforms, insurance portals,
and payment-integrated applications.
